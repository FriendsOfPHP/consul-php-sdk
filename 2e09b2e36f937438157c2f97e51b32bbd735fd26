Unfortunately, this PR is a BC break. You can add the status as an third / optionnel  argument.

I have to agree this is a pretty major problem. We've had a few problems in testing our locking abstraction and have been forced to resort to strpos on the exception messages...

Unfortunately it would have BC implementations but IMHO ->get should return null if not found (404). Exceptions should be for exceptional situations.
