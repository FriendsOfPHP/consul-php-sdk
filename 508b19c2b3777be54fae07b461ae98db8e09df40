Did you ever see the binary in an archive?

Yes, after running
composer.phar require sensiolabs/consul-php-sdk

a du -h has the following output

131M	./vendor/sensiolabs/consul-php-sdk/bin

I am not sure exactly how the project is distributed, but running composer.phar archive with my patch does exclude the bin folder.
